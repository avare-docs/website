**About the products** We believe aviators need apps that are easy to
use, affordable, and work on all of their mobile devices. All our apps
are free, designed to run on nearly all Android devices, focus on
simplicity, and include no push ads or invasive Permissions.

**About the development team** Our team was founded in September of
2012 by engineer, Android developer, and pilot, **[Zubair Khan](http://zk4u.blogspot.com/ "Zubair's Blog")**.
He credits pilot friends John, Peter, Ron, and Tiberius as
co-founders. Our focus is on contributing to the aviation & coding
communities, and having fun so we've developed and continued to evolve
a [Philosophy and Guidelines](https://apps4av.net/site/about-2/philosophy/ "Philosophy").

In 2014 the code had been developed to enable free geo-referenced FAA
Plates for IFR situational awareness. The work of manually tagging and
verifying coordinate points on the Plates was then taken on by a large
group of volunteers. For ongoing maintenance and updating of the
Plates, volunteers include: **Clyde C, Ingo N, Joe L, Kendell B, Peter
G, Ron W, Stuart D, Tal R, TV, Frank S, Domenic P, and Zubair K**.

So far all contributors are aviators, and working as volunteers
donating their efforts to the Aviation and Android communities.

**About making a financial donation towards our expenses**

page. To save time and simply donate now, please use the **_Paypal_**

that your Avare device is online, launch Avare, tap the **Map** tab,
then the **Menu** button, then the **Help** button.The two donate
buttons are at the bottom of that screen.

While we are an all-volunteer group, in order to provide the
protections and benefits of non-profit status for our users the Avare
team formed **Apps4Av, Inc.** as a registered 
[non-profit organization](http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSummary.aspx?FEIN=463956765 "Non-Profit Status") 
in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. For your convenient and secure
financial contributions, we use the _**PayPal**_ service, which
accepts major credit cards. Avare is an open source project on
[GitHub](http://github.com/apps4av/avare "Avare Source Code on Github"). 
Please donate to keep the project improving. Any amount will
be appreciated.

**All donations to Apps4Av Inc. are tax deductible under

code of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).** Note that you can
select a single donation **One Time Donation** you can optionally do
again for any amount at any time.  If you choose an ongoing **Periodic
Donation** (Subscription), it saves you the small effort of repeating
the One Time Donation process, helps us to plan our budget
expenditures based on income, and still allows you to easily cancel or

We appreciate you taking the time to consider donating funds to help with our costs.

_Thank you!_

Please contact us on our
[**Forum**](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apps4av-forum) if
you'd like to **volunteer your services**. We enjoy the fun and
fascination of developing and extending the apps, and there's a
special delight in sharing them freely with other aviators. The
complete Avare source code is available on
[Github](https://github.com/about "About GitHub") at this URL:
[http://github.com/apps4av/avare](http://github.com/apps4av/avare "Avare on GitHub")

As part of our mission to provide affordable resources for aviators,
we're actively developing ADS-B solutions for Avare. You can help by
**loaning or donating** an ADS-B receiver so that we can add it to the
list of devices supported by Avare.

We also welcome any and all **feedback, requests, suggestions or
questions** on our
**[Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apps4av-forum "Apps4Av Forum")**
about any of our products. Aviator and programmer questions and
feedback there help all our users and our all-volunteer development
team. Such feedback has helped us to continue rapidly improving Avare
and all our apps. _**\*Please Note**_ that any negative feedback you
share in an app store Review might discourage other pilots from trying
our products, so given that they're free and improving very rapidly we
hope you'll join us in **posting positive Google Play Store reviews**
encouraging pilots to try them out.
